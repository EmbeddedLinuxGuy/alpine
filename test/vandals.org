*** Playing Vandals \& Varmints

\begin{tabular}{|l r|l|}
\hline
          &    Die & Bonus \\ \hline
Intiative &     d6 & Dex \\
Attack    &    d20 & AC, To Hit, Str/Dex \\
Damage    & varies & for special weapons \\
Save      &    d20 & by class and level \\
Skill     &    d12 & per skill \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Select the appropriate die, roll, and add
any applicable bonuses.  For example, roll a
high number on a 20-sided die to successfully land a blow in
hand-to-hand combat (Attack roll).

*** Dice
These conventions will allow you to play any of the Gygaxian /
Arnesonian games of the mid-70's, or their modern variants.

A d6 refers to a 6-sided die, d20 to a 20-sided die, 3d6 to the sum
total shown on three six sided dice, and so on. To roll a d3, roll a
six sided die and count a 1 or 2 as rolling a 1, 3 or 4 as a 2, and 5 or 6
as a 3. For a d2, 1-3 counts as a 1 and 4-6 as a 2.

*** Armor Class

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
9 & Unarmed \\
8 & Shield \\
7 & Leather Armor \\
6 & Leather + Shield \\
5 & Chainmail \\
4 & Chainmail + Shield \\
3 & Plate Mail \\
2 & Plate Mail + Shield \\
1 & Plate Mail + Heavy Shield \\
\end{tabular}\\


This table assumes a small, light shield or buckler; a large heavy
shield reduces armor class by an additional point (base AC 7 instead
of 8).

*** Saving Throws

When a character is threatened by imminent doom, the player may make a
saving throw to avoid or at least mitigate the worst effects. Like the
attack roll, the player must roll a 20 or better on a d20, after
adding bonuses. Each character starts with a save bonus which is
typically +4 or +5, and increases every few levels. Add your
Constitution bonus on saves vs. shocks to the system; for example
poisons, paralysis, petrification, or surviving the effects of
polymorphing or resurrection. Add your Dexterity bonus against attacks
such as breath weapons (e.g. fire-breathing varmints), magic wands and
death rays. Add Wisdom against mind-attack spells and charms.

Some characters will receive additional bonuses based on class or
race. For example, those of dwarven or halfling heritage may receive
an additional +4 on all saves vs. magic due to innate resistance;
elves are generally immune to paralysis attacks by ghouls. Mystical
characters might take an extra +2 vs. poison or paralysis due to
divine favor, while magic users are typically granted +2 vs. spells
cast by any opponents because of their understanding of arcane
effects.

*** Using Skills

Every character starts with three skills at a +1 bonus: Listen,
Search, and Force Doors. To successfully use the skill, the player
must roll 12 or better on a d12, after adding the skill bonus. For
example if a character wants to search a room, the referee may ask the
player to make a Search check for every 10 minutes spent looking.  Any
roll of 11 or 12, when combined with the +1 search bonus, is enough
for the character to find what she is looking for. Elves get an extra
+2 bonus when looking for secret doors; dwarves get +2 to find
stonework traps or faults. All characters also start with an
additional skill of their choice at +3; at the referee's discretion, the
character may acquire or improve a skill once every few levels.

Skilled characters should select four or five professional skills, and
10 points in skill bonuses, assigning a bonus of +1 to +4 for each
skill. For instance a thief might start with Sneak +3, Climb +2, Locks
\& Traps +1, and Pick Pockets +4. At each level the thief receives a +1
in each of 3 skills, up to a maximum of +10 per skill (rolling a 1 is
always a failure). The player may opt to apply a +1 to Listen or
Search instead. When choosing a professional skill, the player and
referee should decide which (if any) attribute bonus should apply to
the skill roll; in the case of the thief, the Dexterity bonus could be
used for each skill.

*** Sample Characters

Fornax the Couth \\
Sheila the Enchanter \\
Wheezer the Schrat \\
- able to banish werewolves and werebears \\
- fishing skills \\
*** Personality Tables
Roll a d20 and consult the appropriate table 1-20; roll again to
select a personality trait. Do this 3-4 times, discarding any results
you don't like.
